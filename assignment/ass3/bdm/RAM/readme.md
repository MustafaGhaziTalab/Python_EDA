# Introduction:
The dataset presented is focused on the prediction of water quality and consists of 5,956,842 entries with 24 columns. The dataset contains many indicators, including pH, iron concentration, nitrate concentration, chloride concentration, and others. Also, there are environmental elements such as water and air temperature, month, day, time of day, and an outcome variable. The objective of this analysis is to explore the dataset, discover patterns, trends, and outliers, and gain knowledge about the distributions and correlations among variables.


# Task Overview

## Data Selection and Preprocessing

* Used the Kaggle API and Google Colab for importing the dataset.
* Analysed the dataset, identifiedÂ and displayed the 24 columns and 5,956,842 entries.
* Checked for missing values, removed columnsÂ that were not necessary (Index, Air Temperature), and dropped entries that had missing values. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Implemented statistical analysis and visualisations to better understand the dataset.
* Created histograms and box plots to visually represent the distributions of numerical variables and detect any outliers.
* Created a correlation heatmap to analyse the associations among theÂ variables.
