## Automated Feature Engineering Tools Assignment
The interesting field of automated feature engineering tools in data science is examined in this assignment. A key step that can reduce time spent and raise the caliber of features used in machine learning models is automated feature engineering. H20.ai and PyCaret are the tools used in this project.

### Dataset: Predict Diabetes
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Below are the steps in feature engineering
1. **Dataset Selection**: The first task is to select a suitable dataset for this assignment. Able to choose a dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other relevant dataset source. Make sure the dataset is in a format that can be easily loaded into Google Colab.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: Use Python libraries like Pandas to load the selected dataset into your Colab notebook. Upload the dataset from the local machine or load it directly from an online source.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. This includes checking for missing values, understanding the data types, and getting a sense of the dataset's structure.

4. **Feature Engineering with Automated Tools**: In this assignment, explore and use automated feature engineering tools to generate new features from the dataset. Some popular libraries for automated feature engineering such as H20.ai and PyCaret are the tools used in this project.

5. **Feature Selection**: After generating new features with automated tools, select the most relevant ones for the analysis. Use techniques like feature importance or domain knowledge to choose the most important features.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the transformed and newly created features to gain insights into their distributions and relationships with the target variable.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings, the feature engineering steps that have been taken with automated tools, and why those decisions.

### Conclusion 
H20.ai
  - We can conclude that using this AutoML such as H20.ai, we got to see different kinds of model summaries to conclude the data.

PyCaret
  - We can see that this dataset is using Feature Engineering with Automated Tools which is AutoML tools PyCaret. We can conclude that using these tools, we know that Linear Discriminant Analysis is the best model to predict this dataset compared with other models such as Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, or Logistic Regression. We can also compare and study the different types of plots at evaluate models such as Treshold,Pipelines Plot, and many more as you can see in the table above.
